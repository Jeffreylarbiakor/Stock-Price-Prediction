# Stock-Price-Prediction

A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms.

The secret of a successful stock trader is being able to look into the future of the stocks and make wise decisions. Accurate prediction of stock market returns is a very challenging task due to volatile and non-linear nature of the financial stock markets. With the introduction of artificial intelligence and increased computational capabilities, programmed methods of prediction have proved to be more efficient in predicting stock prices.

 Here, we are provided dataset of a public stock market for 104 stocks. Our goal is to forecast the future closing prices for these stocks with your Data Science skills for the next 2 months
